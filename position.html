            <h1>Sticky Navigation</h1>
                <p>Sticky navigation works best with retail, eCommerce, and other types of “actionable” sites where the designer intends for a user to take a specific action, such as a click to purchase a product. In those cases, sticky menus have been shown to significantly improve the customer experience, by keeping users well-oriented and giving them more control over their journey through your site.Alongside other interactive navigation techniques, the effectiveness of the sticky element was found to improve the performance in basic selection tasks of older adults and to provide similar benefits (although smaller) to younger users.

                So, why do older adults and younger users respond better to sticky navigation? It’s because of the relatively lower confidence levels of older adults and much younger users on the web and their subsequent need for additional support, which sticky navigation provides. Older adults and young users respond well to the confidence that sticky navigation menus instill.Every brand can benefit from having friendly and intuitive navigation, especially on pages with lots of content that require visitors to scroll. Clear on-page navigation helps visitors make a smooth journey through the content on the page in a manageable way. While “back to top” links can help achieve a similar goal, sticky navigation is a quicker, easier way to let visitors jump to a new page on your site and continue their experience.

The left-hand side of the image shows a Contentsquare mouse-scroll heat map that was generated before the site implemented sticky navigation. The heatmap of the right-hand of the image shows how much further people scroll down once the site implemented sticky navigation. The results speak for themselves!
